# Backend Migration Project

## Introduction
This project involves the creation of a Spring Framework Java backend for a web application previously using an outdated backend system. The objective is to modernize the application's backend while maintaining seamless integration with the existing Angular front-end. The new backend will address critical technical debts and improve system reliability and performance. The skills demonstrated in completing this application will be invaluable for technical interviews and can be showcased in your professional portfolio.

## Scenario
I have been tasked with developing a minimally viable product (MVP) to migrate a legacy backend system built in the early 1990s for a travel agency. The front-end team has been facing numerous bugs and issues due to the outdated nature of the backend. Your chief technology officer (CTO) has selected the modern Spring Framework for this migration project.
